abstract = {This paper provides an overview of our open Ultra Video Group (UVG) dataset that is composed of 16 versatile 4K (3840\texttimes{}2160) test video sequences. These natural sequences were captured either at 50 or 120 frames per second (fps) and stored online in raw 8-bit and 10-bit 4:2:0 YUV formats. The dataset is published on our website (ultravideo.cs.tut.fi) under a non-commercial Creative Commons BY-NC license. In this paper, all UVG sequences are described in detail and characterized by their spatial and temporal perceptual information, rate-distortion behavior, and coding complexity with the latest HEVC/H.265 and VVC/H.266 reference video codecs. The proposed dataset is the first to provide complementary 4K sequences up to 120 fps and is therefore particularly valuable for cutting-edge multimedia applications. Our evaluations also show that it comprehensively complements the existing 4K test set in VVC standardization, so we recommend including it in subjective and objective quality assessments of next-generation VVC codecs.},
